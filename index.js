Helge Drews - Software Engineer 🦊

Hello! 👋😃 I'm Helge, a full-stack software engineer focused on web development.
I’m currently working on Jamstack webpages built with ES6, React, Node.js, Contentful, AWS and a lot of other third party services.
I also use Python 🐍 for webdev and for RaspberryPi fun.
